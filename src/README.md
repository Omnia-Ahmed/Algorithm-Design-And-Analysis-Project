- Compile the NetworkFlow.cs and place all the binary files in a directory you will make called bin so that it's path looks like this: "bin/NetworkFlow.exe".

- Make sure  that you name the binary of the network flow code is called NetworkFlow.exe.

- Make tests directory at the root.

- Make running_time directory at the root.

- run the binary of main.cpp and wait for it.

### Notes
