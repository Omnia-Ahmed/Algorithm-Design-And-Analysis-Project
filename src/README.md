# How to run the program on windows
- Compile the main.cpp file and place the binary file at the root directory (Here I named the binary file "Algorithm Project.exe" (without quotes). You can name it anything you want as long you place it at the root).

- Compile the NetworkFlow.cs and place all the binary files in a directory you will make called bin so that it's path looks like this: "bin/NetworkFlow.exe".

- Make sure  that you name the binary of the network flow code is called NetworkFlow.exe.

- Make tests directory at the root.

- Make running_time directory at the root.

- run the binary of main.cpp and wait for it.

### Notes
- When placing the binary of the C# code place all the files including the .dll files and other files important for it to work.

- The Ford Flukerson code will take a an increadibly long time to run.
