# Algorithm-Design-And-Analysis-Project
This was our algorithms course project at FCIS Ain Shams University.

This project aims to analyze and compare three famous network flow algorithms which are Edmonds Karp, Ford Flukerson and Dinic. We have also reviewed [A Fast Network Flow Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04848) scientific paper.

To generate the test cases for this project we used [testlib.h](https://github.com/MikeMirzayanov/testlib/) which is used in many competitive programming competitions to generate the test cases. To get the correct answer to the test cases I used a recent submit I did in [Data Structures And Algorithm Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) where you can find my submit at my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aKhfagy/data-structures-algorithms) for all my submitions in it. 

To obtain the same results from the [statistical analysis of the run time](https://github.com/aKhfagy/Algorithm-Design-And-Analysis-Project/blob/main/docs/Statistical%20Analysis.pdf) please follow the steps [here](https://github.com/aKhfagy/Algorithm-Design-And-Analysis-Project/blob/main/src/README.md) and run the first hundred test cases. After that open the [notebook](https://github.com/aKhfagy/Algorithm-Design-And-Analysis-Project/blob/main/running_time/Statistical%20Analysis.ipynb) and run all the cells.

This project was under the supervision of Dr. Ahmed Salah.
