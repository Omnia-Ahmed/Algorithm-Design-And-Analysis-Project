# Algorithm-Design-And-Analysis-Project
This was our algorithms course project at FCIS Ain Shams University.

This project aims to analyze and compare two famous network flow algorithms which are Edmonds Karp and Ford Flukerson. We have also reviewed [A Fast Network Flow Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04848) scientific paper and wrote high level psudo code for it.

To generate the test cases for this project we used [testlib.h](https://github.com/MikeMirzayanov/testlib/) which is used in many competitive programming competitions to generate the test cases.
